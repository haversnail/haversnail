### Hi there 👋

I'm Alex, a software engineer, user experience designer, Marine Corps veteran, and passionate digital creative with measured experience in various technical fields with project management and leadership positions.

I'm palpably passionate about solving complex problems with like-minded people. 🧠 I always advocate for best-in-class developer experiences that empower others to solve complex problems, faster. ⚙️

When I'm not clacking away on an overpriced keyboard ⌨️, you can find me misting my plants 🌱, obsessing over what renovation to tackle next 🏡, or spending quality time with my wife and son. 👨‍👩‍👦
